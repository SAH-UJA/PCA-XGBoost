# PCA XGBoost
 
This repo demonstrates the use of PCA for reducing dataset with large number of columns. In this example, the principle components taken are 2 therefore the 100 feature randomly generated dataset is converted to a 2 column dataset. Binary Classification is then done using the 2 columns and XGBoost Classifier. The accuracy is less since the dataset is generated using the numpy's random generator.
